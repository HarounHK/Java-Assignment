Program description:
This program has a real life function and will work as a recipe finder.
The user will enter an ingredient i.e a word and it will chech the textfile list
which is a number of textfiles with recipes inside and return a list of files with that word inside.
It will also return the number of times the specific word is located within the file.

The user can also enter two words seperated by && and it will search for a recipe i.e textfile
that contains both of these words.

This way i have completed the assignment while also creating a real life application that someone can use.
For example if someone has an ingredient or some food. They can type it into the recipe finder and it will provide them
with recipes that contain that food.


Note:
There are some pieces of code i got online. I will be placing it all below here just so you know.
I did implement the lines of code that i found online in my own way. I
did not just copy and paste. 

1. The for each loop - I found this loop online and implemented it in the program
2. I got the error message part from here, online JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this,"Please enter a word to search.", "Error", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE
3. This piece of code i did not write but used in my program in order to make my code work, String[] words = word.split("\\s*&&\\s*");
